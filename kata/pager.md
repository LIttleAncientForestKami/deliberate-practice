Pager
=====
Thanks to Tomasz Kaczanowski!

Basic form of a pager: < > or Next Previous.

Test-drive an implementation of a pager that:

- will work with many GUI implementations
- will tell you current page number
- will enable user to go to last page
- will enable user to go to first page
- will tell user how many pages there are

Take your time, but be aware of how much you needed.
