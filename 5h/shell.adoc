== Shell

Please create an interactive shell. Said shell should

. display the starting directory
.. starting directory is where we start, naturally
. allow to navigate directories with a `cd` command
. allow to list files with a `ls` command
. allow to create a new empty file with a `[]` command 
.. followed by the file name: `[] empty`
.. no name should inform that a name is required
. offer help for commands.
.. each command should have a usage, which:
.. at the minimum, informs of what the command does and offers one example
.. is called via appending `-h` to a command, like so: `[] -?` or `ls -?`
. quit on `qt`
. be extensible with other commands
. tell that it doesn't know the command when we enter something else
