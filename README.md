deliberate-practice
===================

Problems to tackle for code kata, callisthenics etc.

Also, code from various practice sites (on relevant branches or in relevant dirs)

Thanks to software craftsmanship circles for solidifying this idea in me and for my parents and violin for instilling it.

## 15min

15 min section came to be due to Yusen Zhang. My thanks, Yusen.
Idea is to have a short exercise in under 15 minutes.

## 1h

1h section was a natural evolution of the 15min one, which was nicely show-cased and used during Java Academy. 

Some tasks take more than 15 minutes. Some only at first (fetching a page via HTTP, when done for the first time, using new Java 11 API, took around 30-40m), some even after numerous tries. Also, LeetCode has a nice section for exams and they take 1h.

## Kata

Code Katas are problems to do some repeated practice. Idea is taken from martial arts kata - aka shadow-fight, where by repeating a set of motions you enable your body to learn it (muscle memory training).
While some would challenge the notion of repeated practice and muscle memory in programming - and they aren't without merit - these problems still allow practicing specific API and present a challenge on their own.

## 5h

Take one of tasks here if you have 5 hours (or less if you're more experienced). Try coding this seriously, with tests, separate repository, Maven/Gradle and all that. More like small projects to be handled.
