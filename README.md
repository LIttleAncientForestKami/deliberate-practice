===================

Problems to tackle for code kata, callisthenics etc.

Also, code from various practice sites (on relevant branches or in relevant dirs)

## 15min

15 min branch came to be due to Yusen Zhang. My thanks, Yusen.
Idea is to have a short exercise in under 15 minutes.

## Kata

Code Katas are problems to do some repeated practice. Idea is taken from martial arts kata - aka shadow-fight, where by repeating a set of motions you enable your body to learn it (muscle memory training).
While some would challenge the notion of repeated practice and muscle memory in programming - and they aren't without merit - these problems still allow practicing specific API and present a challenge on their own.

## 5h

Take one of tasks here if you have 5 hours (or less if you're more experienced). Try coding this seriously, with tests, separate repository, Maven/Gradle and all that. More like small projects to be handled.
